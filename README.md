# Terminal Stables 
A text based terminal game written in python


The objective of this project was to practice newly learned python syntax and functionality by writing an interactive text based game using object oriented programming principles.
In the game, you will be prompted for your horse trainer name, and the names of the three horses you start with in your stable. 
From there, you can:
1. View your stable 
  - View the horses in your stable and their important attributes, like name, sex, level, and number of competitions won.
2. Groom your horses
  - After grooming a foal (baby) three times, they grow up into an adult.
3. Compete your horses
  - Winning a competition is random. 
  - Horses are leveled up every two competitions won.
4. Breed your horses
  - Choose the mare and stallion you want to breed, and name the foal. The sex of the foal is randomly chosen and the breed is randomly chosen as 'quarter horse' or 'mustang'. 
   
In the future I would like to add functionality for the user to choose two breeds at the start of the game, as well as add more actions that can be done. Additionally, I would like to create a way to increase the chances of winning a competition as the level of your horse increases. 

Happy horsing!
